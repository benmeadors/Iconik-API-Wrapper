# Iconik API Wrapper

This is my on-going project to create an API wrapper in Python for Iconik.io. Iconik is a hybrid-cloud asset management system. I wrote this for myself to save time, and for the rest of my team to reference as they start to learn Python too. This was also a chance for me to explore classes in Python. 

Specifically, this wrapper can do the following

### Assets
-get asset info
-calculate asset duration
-get signed url for proxy file of asset
-request a new transcription ID 
-add metdata
-add any kind of bulk segment via JSON payload 

### Users
-Get user's info from Iconik

### Jobs
-get a job's info from Iconik
-create a new job
-update an existing job
